# Before you start testing

I didn't include the node_modules becuase there huge and its bad practice to include them.

## Setup
Go into the root folder and run npm init. This will create the node_modules folder. You will also need to install all the dependices I use with the following command

```bash
npm i <package>
```

For the Frontend part of the project I used react so you need to use

```bash
create-react-app <name of folder>
```

and to run the application use the command

```bash
npm run testing

```
## Install dependencies
To find the dependencies you need to install just read the package.json files and look at the dependecies section.
